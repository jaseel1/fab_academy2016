<h3>Designing</h3>

Previous Weeks I learned  designing tools [Antimony](http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/antimony/3/) and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) ,this week i started to learning [Rhino](https://www.rhino3d.com/) from [Yadhu Sharon](http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/fablabtrivandrum/students/384/index.html).

first i transferred my imagination from my brain to paper.

Calculated hinges dimension and place then i started designing in [Rhino](https://www.rhino3d.com/) .


: ![Rhino design]({% asset_path rhino.gif%})Used  Array Tool for multiplying hinges thats a nice tool,This Video Tutorial will help you to understand how to use array in rhino.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6FJPqsY2Gk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6FJPqsY2Gk)

[Download .3dm(Rhino file]({% asset_path Bookshelf_shopbot_11mm.3dm%})

I created a Laser cut miniature version in cardboard.also i aligned design to reduce material wastage.

<h3>Designing for ShopBot</h3>

ShopBot can't cut sharp inner edges properly , to avoid this issue we need to add an extra pocket in the inner corners,also you need to consider Bit Size while designing the model(i used 1/8" Spiral Bit for cutting plywood)
