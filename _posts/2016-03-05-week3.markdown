   Vinyl Cutting
  </h4>
  <p>
   I created a Vinyl Sticker of “Pacman” ,I used 4 colors vinyl sheets for this sticker .
  </p>
  <p>
   I searched many 2D Vector Softwares finally i decided  to do with Inkscpae , i am new to inkscape thats why i spent first 3 hours to learn inkscape basics.
   <br/>
   I followed this
   <a href="https://inkscape.org/en/learn/tutorials/">
    Inkscape Tutorials
   </a>
   to learn Inkscape basics,and I searched many tutorials and got one ,I created each objects in seperate layers thats very important to multi layer Vinyl Sticker
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Note : If you are designing a multilayer vinyl sticker make all objects in seperate layers
   </strong>
   .
   <br/>
   <img alt=" " src="{% asset_path Completed.png %}" title="Completed Image"/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Layer&gt;Layers
   </strong>
   for  Layers Menu, I named all layers is the name of vinyl color to be print,then you can show/Hide Each layers.
  </p>
  <p>
   <img alt=" " src="{% asset_path pac-man-4.png %}" title="Pacman in Inkscape"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   I used tis property to make mouth of “Pacman” we can adjust the minimum and maximum angles
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    File&gt;Save AS
   </strong>
   to .png then you will get PNG of each layers
  </p>
  <p>
   Then go to
   <strong>
    Vinyl Cutting
   </strong>
   Machine
   <br/>
   <img alt=" " src="{{ site.url }}/assets/{% asset_path WP_20160218_005.jpg %}" width="800px" height="600px""Vinyl Cutter"'/>
   <br/>
   before using vinyl machine we can test its blade properly fit,feed the vinyl sheet of your selected color ,Normally R,G,B,Y,W colors are available
   <br/>
   you can use both roll and piece , I prefer sheet always .
  </p>
  <p>
   <img/>
   <br/>
   if you are selecting roll the machine not meassuring the length of roll, if you are using piece it will meassure both length and width
   <br/>
   <img alt=" " src="{% asset_path WP_20160218_004.jpg %}" width="800px" height="600px" title="Select Piece"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   <img/>
   <br/>
   We can operate Vinyl Cutter using Fab Modules
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Terminal&gt;fab
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <img alt=" " src="{% asset_path vinyl3.png %}" width="800px" height="600px" title="Fab Module Vinyl"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   Select png and Vinyl Cutter
   <br/>
   <img alt=" " src="{% asset_path ndm6.png %}" width="800px" height="600px" title="Fab Module"/>
   <br/>
   Then select the correct png file then check length and with is ok then make path and print
  </p>
  <p>
   Print all the PNG files for each layers
   <br/>
   <img alt=" " src="{% asset_path WP_20160216_001.jpg %}" width="800px" height="600px" title="Vinyl Pieces"/>
   <br/>
   Then Peel unwanted portion using needle knife very carefully
   <br/>
   <img alt=" " src="{% asset_path WP_20160216_002.jpg %}" width="800px" height="600px" title="Peeling%}"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   <img alt=" " src="{% asset_path WP_20160216_003.jpg %}" width="800px" height="600px" title="peel vinyl"/>
   <br/>
   Then Paste int to Laptop or any other smooth surface .
  </p>
  <p>
   Then it looks like a Pacman Game

  <h3 id="press-fit-box">
   Press Fit Box
  </h3>
  <p>
   I designed a press fit box using My Favourite tool Antimony and i realized antimony have some limitations  but it is good for simple structures.
  </p>
  <p>
   I created 6 sides of boxes as a cube then added small cubes 3 mm width for notches and teeth..
   <br/>
   This is the View of Antomy
   <br/>
   <img/>
   <img alt=" " src="{% asset_path laser/2.png %}" width="800px" height="600px" title="Antimony"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt=" " src="{% asset_path laser/1.png %}" width="800px" height="600px" title="Anti 2"/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Exporting PNG from Antomony
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <img alt=" " src="{% asset_path laser/3.png%}" width="800px" height="600px" title="Heightmap"/>
   <br/>
   Antomy have an option to export “Heightmap Images” .png ,normally we are using this heightmap images for CNC Milling but i just tried it for laser cutting its working but need to do some additional works using inkscape
   <br/>
   <img alt=" " src="{% asset_path laser/4.png %}" width="800px" height="600px" title="Inkscape"/>
   <img/>
   <br/>
   For laser Cutting we need Red Lines in antimony png image only black lines, i opened that .png in Inkscape  and Draw using pentool(red color) in top of black line after mapping all required lines i deleted the previous image file then i got all laser cutting lines in red color
   <br/>
   <img/>
   <br/>
   Then Ctrl+P print to laser cutter and placed a cardbord sheet in laser cutting machine,after adjusting z axis i printed it.
   <br/>
   <img/>
   <br/>
   after printing it joined all pieces in the shape of a box,it is not perfect i designed for 6mm acrylic sheet but cardboard have only 3mm thickness thats why got some extra notch length
   <br/>
