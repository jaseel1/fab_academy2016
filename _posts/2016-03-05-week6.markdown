I have previous experience with [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) and [Eagle](http://www.cadsoftusa.com).Thats why i want to try 123D.I heard that name in many places especialy  in [Instructables](instructables.com).

I started with [123D Circuits](http://www.123dapp.com/circuits) i got some advice like "123D is easy to use for beginers but it is not good for complex circuits" .

>I want to add a Button and LED to Hello ISP Board ,when pressing buttun LED will glow.

My 123D Circuit: ![gras]({% asset_path 123d.png%})

Selection of Proper components is little difficult in 123D footprint is important and we are using SMD Components only,I added the following components.

 123D have an option to add extra components out of their librarry ,users can design their own componnet footprints,and it also have an option to import [Eagle](http://www.cadsoftusa.com) projects.

**Gerber to PNG Traces**

>Gerber is a standard electronics industry file format used to communicate design information to manufacturing for many types of printed circuit boards.

You can download 'Gerber' in .Zip format from 123D ![download Gerber]({% asset_path downloadgerber.png%})

 I want **.png** format for milling the PCB ,but now i have only **Gerber** files .I found an online Tool [http://circuitpeople.com](http://circuitpeople.com/) .it is very simple to use.

You Can Upload your Gerber file in .Zip format to Circuit People](http://circuitpeople.com/)

![Circuit People]({% asset_path circuitpeople.png%})

Then We can view all the Gerber files in .png format,also have an option to download all images in a single zip file.

**Circuit Designing using Eagle**

I got PNG files from 123D but i want to learn Eagle Also ,Thats why i designed same circuit in Eagle,
If you are installing Fab Library for Eagle, you will get exact Fablab Components easily ,You can download Fablab Eagle Library from Here.

Eagle is so professional compared to 123D.

When You are exporting (FIle>Export>image)  PNG from Eagle you should tick Monochrome ,Make 600 dpi minimum dpi(I used 1000dpi) and Trace Width(File>Design Rules) to 20 Mil.

**PCB Milling**

 I already expalained in [Week 4:Electronics Production](http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/fablabtrivandrum/students/390/jekyll/update/2016/02/17/week4.html)  how to mill PCB from PNG

Then..... Board is Ready How to Program ? I am explaining in [Week 8 :Embedded Programing](http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/fablabtrivandrum/students/390/jekyll/update/2016/03/16/week8.html)
