**Assignement**

>  design a 3D mold, machine it, and cast parts from it


What i am going to do
======================

I want to make a casted wrist band using rubber .

Mould
===========


I had done sand casting in my college days

 ,now i am going to make a real mould in wax,We are using **Machinable Wax** for it .

Why Using Machinable Wax?
===========================

Machinable Wax is a very hard Wax having **High Melting Point** specially designed for Machining Applications .


Mould Designing in Rhino
==========================
I designed a Negative Mould in Rhino  for my Wrist Band, What is Negative Mould ? You Can easily understand by looking the following picture.

Yaa, I created a mould design in Rhino , Now it is ready to Export to **.STL** format for Milling in Modella or ShopBot .

Milling Mould in Modella
=======================

Modella supports **STL** file thats a new information to me also have an option to convert **.STL** to **.PNG** , I used 1/8" Bits for both Rough Cut and Finishing Cut .

Rough Cut and Finishing Cut
==========================
This 2 level cuting method saves energy and time also gives a good finishing , Yaa rough cut removes major portion of the unwanted wax by milling and same time finishing cuts makes smooth and accurate.

Yaa, Mould is Ready . Next step is Casting.


Casting Process
==============

This is the process of filling mould by which material we want to use ie, Rubber, Silicone,Plastic,Metal etc...

Now i am going to use Silicone Rubber(SORTA Clear 37)

SORTA Clear 37
==============
It is a Water white translucent silicone rubbers which cure at room temperature with negligible shrinkage and feature high tensile and tear strength.


SORTA Clear Part A and Part B: ![SORTA CLear Part A ]({% asset_path sortaclear.jpg%})


List of Materials needs for Casting
==================================
1.Mould
2.Sorta Clear 37 :Part A
3.Sorta Clear 37 :Part B
4.Water
5.Plastic Cup
6.Wooden Stick
7.Aluminium Foil
8.Patience :) :) Your Patience will indicate in your final Result .

Process
=======

1.First fill your Mould with water and pour that water into a Vaccant Glass (It is for measuring the volume of mould)
2.Take Part A and Part B in  Glasses (Equal to 1/2 Volume of Mould)
3:Mix It(1:1 Ratio)
4:Add  1 drop of Coloring Agent(If you need color)
5.Pour the mixed material carefully to Mould (Be careful to air bubbles that makes holes in final product)
6.Remove Unwanted Material from Mould
7.Wait 4 Hours then Open the Mould
