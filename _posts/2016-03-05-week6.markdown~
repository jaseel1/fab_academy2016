I have previous experience with [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) and [Eagle](http://www.cadsoftusa.com).Thats why i want to try 123D.I heard that name in many places especialy  in [Instructables](instructables.com).

I started with [123D Circuits](http://www.123dapp.com/circuits) i got some advice like "123D is easy to use for beginers but it is not good for complex circuits" .

>I want to make a Electronic Tossing Device ,when pressing button one  LED Lights  randomly  out of two LEDs .

Selection of Proper components is little difficult in 123D footprint is important and we are using SMD Components only,I added the following components.

 123D have an option to add extra componnets out of their librarry ,users can design their own componnet footprints,and it also have an option to import [Eagle](http://www.cadsoftusa.com) projects.
