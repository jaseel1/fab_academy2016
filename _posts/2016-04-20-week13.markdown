What i am going to do
======================

>I want to make a speedometer using LED Arrays using a Optical Encoders.



Optical Encoder
===============
An optical encoder is an electromechanical device which has an electrical output  proportional to the angular position of the input shaft.

It is normally used for Closed Loop Control in Printers,CNC Machines etc...

Encoder Principle: ![Encoder ]({% asset_path encoderworking.jpg%})
Encoder Attached to Motor: ![Encoder ]({% asset_path encoder2.jpg%})

Reading from Encoder
====================
I am using Quadrature Encoder which have Two digital outputs (Channel A and Channel B) ,Quardrature encoder gives direction of rotation using this two channels

Quadrature Encoder Working: ![Quadrature Encoder ]({% asset_path quadrature.jpg%})

I got a Quadrature Encoder from an OLD Printer ,thats shown below .
Encoder from Old Printer: ![Mini Motor Printer Encoder  ]({% asset_path minimotorencoder.jpg%})

We can easily get direction and no of rotations from analyzing this outputs.

[Charlieplexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlieplexing)
==========================
I want to display Motor RPM using a LED array for that iam using Charlieplexing Technique.  a Charlieplexing is a technique for driving Multiplexed LEDs in which relatively few I/O pins Microcontrollers.
ATtiny45 have only 6 IO pins if we need to control 6 LEDS normally we want 6 PINS , But if you are using Charlieplexing you can control (n2 âˆ’ n) LEDs. where 'n' is no of available pins .

LED Array Circuit Diagram
=================================
I designed a 6 LED using 3 Pins Circuit in Eagle , in Eagle Layout You can see the LED Array arrangements .

Board
=======================
I arranged PCB Board in a circular shape for displaying LEDs in the form of a speedometer.

Programming
==========================
I used Attiny45 + Arduino , [Charlieplex Library](http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/Charlieplex) available in arduino . That is very easy but you need to understand working of Charlieplexing Circuits .

First I Programmed a simple charlieplexing  Running Light .

Code :  


    #include <Charlieplex.h>
    const int ledpin1 = 2;    // Charlieplexed for 6 LEDs
    const int ledpin2 = 1;
    const int ledpin3 = 0;
    #define NUMBER_OF_PINS 3
    //define pins in the order you want to adress them
    byte pins[] = {ledpin1, ledpin2, ledpin3};
    //initialize object
    Charlieplex charlieplex = Charlieplex(pins , NUMBER_OF_PINS);
    //individual 'pins' , adress charlieplex pins as you would adress an array
    charliePin led1 = { 0 , 1 }; // Set the pins the LEDs are connected to.
    charliePin led2 = { 1 , 2 }; // If the wrong LED lights, change it here.
    charliePin led3 = { 2 , 0 };
    charliePin led4 = { 0 , 2 };
    charliePin led5 = { 2 , 1 };
    charliePin led6 = { 1 , 0 };
    void setup(){
    /*nothing*/
    }
    void loop(){
    charlieplex.charlieWrite(led1,HIGH);
    delay(1000);
    charlieplex.clear();    // Must clear the LED to avoid lighting additional LEDs unintentionally
                      // This sets all 3 pins as an input
    charlieplex.charlieWrite(led2,HIGH);
    delay(1000);
    charlieplex.clear();

    charlieplex.charlieWrite(led3,HIGH);
    delay(1000);
    charlieplex.clear();    // Must clear the LED to avoid lighting additional LEDs unintentionally
                      // This sets all 3 pins as an input
    charlieplex.charlieWrite(led4,HIGH);
    delay(1000);
    charlieplex.clear();
    charlieplex.charlieWrite(led5,HIGH);
    delay(1000);
    charlieplex.clear();    // Must clear the LED to avoid lighting additional LEDs unintentionally
                      // This sets all 3 pins as an input
    charlieplex.charlieWrite(led6,HIGH);
    delay(1000);
    charlieplex.clear();
